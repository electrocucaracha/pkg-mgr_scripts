# QEMU

QEMU is a hosted virtual machine monitor: it emulates the machine's
processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of
different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to
run a variety of guest operating systems. It also can be used with KVM
to run virtual machines at near-native speed (by taking advantage of
hardware extensions such as Intel VT-x). QEMU can also do emulation
for user-level processes, allowing applications compiled for one
architecture to run on another.
