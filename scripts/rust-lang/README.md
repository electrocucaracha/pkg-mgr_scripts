# Rust

![Logo](../../docs/img/rust-lang.jpg)

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance
and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar
to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to
validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage
collection, and reference counting is optional.
